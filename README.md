 FIFOs are often used to safely pass data from one clock  domain to another clock domain. An asynchronous FIFO refers to a FIFO design  where data is written to a FIFO buffer from one clock domain and the same data is read from the FIFO buffer from another clock domain, where the two clock domains are asynchronous to each other.



1) "Asynchronous_fifo_design.pdf " is the report which contains all the detailed blocks of the Asynchronous Fifo, Modelsim simulation outputs, Static Timing Analysis, Magic Layout from magic tool, Qflow, Post Synthesis gate level simulation.

2) "Async_Fifo.v" : contains verilog code for the Asynchronous FIFO

3) "test_Async_Fifo.v" : is the testbench to run the simulation in Modelsim
