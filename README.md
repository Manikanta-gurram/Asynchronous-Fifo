1) "Asynchronous_fifo_design.pdf " : contains all the theory about  Asynchronous FIFO, Block diagram and the outputs of simulation.

2) "Async_fifo.v" : contains verilog code for the Asynchronous FIFO

3) "test_async_fifo.v" : is the testbench to run the simulation in Modelsim

4) "RTL_Async_FIFO.png"  : is the RTL view of designed Asynchronous FIFO
FIFOs are often used to safely pass data from one clock  domain to another clock domain. An asynchronous FIFO refers to a FIFO design  where data is written to a FIFO buffer from one clock domain and the same data is read from the FIFO buffer from another clock domain, where the two clock domains are  asynchronous to each other.
