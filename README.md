# Asynchronous-Fifo
FIFOs are often used to safely pass data from one clock  domain to another clock domain. An asynchronous FIFO refers to a FIFO design  where data is written to a FIFO buffer from one clock domain and the same data is read from the FIFO buffer from another clock domain, where the two clock domains are  asynchronous to each other.
